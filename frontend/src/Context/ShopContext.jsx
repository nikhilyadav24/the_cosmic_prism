}


//what we have done 
// we have created a context ShopContext
//passed it product data, other data in a fn ShopContextProvider and returned as prop to global level

// Now we can fetch data throughout the project using context api

//use ShopContextProvider tag in main.jsx inside browser router to make it alailable throughout the project

//Notes
// createContext -  is used to create a Context object that allows you to share data across the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.
// It helps manage state like themes, authentication status, user settings, etc., at a global level.
